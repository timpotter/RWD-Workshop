#Paper Prototyping Exercise

##A Typical Scenario
So your designer has sent you over a PSD mock up of the final site, problem is, this doesn't indicate how the website will look on multiple devices. Times are changing and designing fixed layouts in Photoshop is fast becoming 'old practice'. Nothing you can do on this occasion however, but you have been tasked with making the website responsive.


##Your challenge
On paper, try and identify the breakpoints and think about how the content will reflow then sketch these out. The site has been designed with a grid so use these as a guide.

> "Breakpoints should not be dictated by devices, but by content. Let the content decide when to expand and when adjust your designs." - Jeremy Keith
